# /etc/init/unicorn-manager.conf - manage a set of unicorns

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple unicorn instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See unicorn.conf for how to manage a single unicorn instance.
#
# Use "stop unicorn-manager" to stop all unicorn instances.
# Use "start unicorn-manager" to start all instances.
# Use "restart unicorn-manager" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
